Git workflow:
- Make sure you are on main branch
- Update main branch:
    - Git fetch / Git pull
- Create a new branch from updated main
- Apply changes to the code
- Stage changed files
- Create a commit with the commit message
- Push your new branch to remote
- Create a Pull Request (Title + description)
- Add reviewers
- Merge to main (on github) after your PR has been approved
- Delete the branch (on github)
- Start from the top locally (checkout to main, update main branch, create new branch and so on)
